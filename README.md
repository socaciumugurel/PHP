# PHP

First you will need to import in the database the file database.sql from includes/DataBase.

This project is about Movies, Books and Music Albums.

On the first page there are generated 8 elements randomly from the database.. If you click on any of them the page will redirect you to the details of that element. You can see the elements divided into categories (Movies, Books and Music Albums) or you can see the full catalog. Breadcrumbs will help you too see in which category you are or to go back to the full catalog. There is also a search button, so you can search thorugh the catalog.
